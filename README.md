# Lessons-from-ByteSize
WebDev lessons from @ByteSizeEvents that I attended. 
The aim for me is to complete them independently and where necessary, seek to learn what I am missing.
And then fiddle with the newly learnt knowledge by trying to build something out of it.

## What did I achieve?
I became more fluent and confident with JavaScript. My main aim for attending the session was to help me in turning a C# game to a JavaScript game as closely as possible. I encountered difficulties with JavaScript's synchronous nature, and even made my browser crash in trying to use `setTimeout` function. I am now comfortable using it as I wish for anything.
I added more functionalities than tasked for, from scratch ... using my imagination, knowledge of twitter and experience with other languages.
The functionalities I added include the option to tweet an image along with the tweet. Ofcourse, I pre-programmed the filepath but I gained some idea of how the BackEnd dev is going to work.

Initially I had the idea to fiddle with the twitter API but the clone turned out to be enough.
Instead I finally learnt all I needed to be able to build my first web-app, a [to-do list](https://tudo.netlify.app/?#) app. 
More ideas have also come around after succeeding in this challenge, and will try to build them soon.
